Thereupon the Lord emerged from that concentration, and he applauded the holy Lord Avalokita, the Bodhisattva, the great 
being: «Well said, well said,son of good family! Just so, son of good family, just so should one course in the course of
the deep perfection of wisdom. As you have explained it, so it is approved by all the Tathagatas.»Thus spoke the Lord. 
Enraptured the Venerable Śāriputra, the holy Lord Avalokita, the Bodhisattva, the great being, and those monks and those
Bodhisattvas, great beings, and the whole world with its gods, men, asuras, garudas and gandharvas rejoiced in the Lord
’s teaching.
